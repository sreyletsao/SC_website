      <p>
        Founded in 2008, Sustainable Cambodia was created in response to the pressing need for educational
        and sustainable development in rural Cambodian villages. Over the years, we’ve expanded our efforts
        to provide clean water, scholarship programs, community training, and environmental conservation
        — always in collaboration with local leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a small group of volunteers, we've grown into a trusted non-profit serving over 120 communities
        and supporting more than 2,500 students as of 2024.
